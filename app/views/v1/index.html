			<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Who this guide is for</h3>
			<p class="govuk-body">This guide is for executors and administrators who need to get the legal right to manage the estate of someone who has died in England and Wales without help from probate specialists. If you need legal advice, you can <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/when-to-use-a-probate-specialist?_ga=2.235346632.875206173.1571647115-905049578.1569505386" target="_blank">pay for a solicitor or probate specialist</a> to do it for you. HM Courts and Tribunal Services cannot give you legal advice.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body">If the person died in Scotland, <a href="https://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/taking-action/dealing-with-a-deceased's-estate-in-scotland" target="_blank">apply for confirmation</a> instead. You’ll need to <a href="https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/applying-probate#toc-0" target="_blank">contact the Probate Office</a> if they died in Northern Ireland.</p>
			<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">This guide is not for probate solicitors or trustees. It covers how to apply if the person who died left a will or did not leave a will.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 id="probate" class="govuk-heading-l">1. Probate</h2>
		<p class="govuk-body">When a person dies, they usually leave an estate including money, possessions and property. Probate is the process of applying for the legal right to deal with the person’s estate.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">If the person who died left a will and you’re applying as an executor named in the will, you’ll get a legal document called a grant of probate. If the person did not leave a will, this is known as intestate, and you’ll need to apply as an administrator for a legal document called ‘letters of administration’.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">Most cases follow this process:</p>
		<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
			<li>search for the will - Search their personal belongings for the will or check with local solicitors. The will should state who must sort and distribute the estate. If the person who died did not leave a will, the next of kin can apply.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/tell-hmrc-estate-value" target="_blank">work out an estimated value</a> of the estate</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/tell-hmrc-estate-value" target="_blank">report the estate’s value</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/paying-inheritance-tax" target="_blank">pay any inheritance tax</a> due</li>
			<li>apply for probate online or by post depending on your circumstances</li>
			<li>use your grant or letters of administration to claim the assets of the person who has died, for example money from their bank accounts</li>
			<li>pay any debts or outstanding taxes, for example unpaid utilities bills distribute the estate – this means giving any property, money or possessions to the people entitled to it (‘beneficiaries’).</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/records" target="_blank">keep a record</a> of your final accounts</li>
		</ol>
		<h2 id="before-you-apply" class="govuk-heading-l">2. Before you apply</h2>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2.1 Check if you need probate</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">Not every estate needs a grant of probate. A grant may not be needed if: the home is held in joint names and passes to the surviving joint owner(s) the estate passes to the surviving spouse or civil partner because it was held in joint names, for example, a savings account.</p>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2.2 Check if probate has been granted in England and Wales only</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">Once an application for probate has been approved, it becomes public record. You can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search-will-probate" target="_blank">search for records</a> for someone who died after 1857 to check if probate has been issued.</p>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>Check if the person left a will or not</li>
			<li>Search the person’s home, personal belongings and with local solicitors for the will.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2.3 If the will is lost</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">If you can’t find the will or it’s lost, you’ll need to send <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-pa13-lost-will-questionnaire" target="_blank">this questionnaire</a> in with your probate application if</p>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>you have a copy of the lost will</li>
			<li>you swear an affidavit confirming what was in the will</li>
			<li>the will is invalid and there’s no other will, and the person who died did not leave a will, this is known as ‘intestate’</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2.4 If they have left a will</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to send the original will - not a photocopy - with your application. You can tell if it’s original if it has a wet signature.</p>
		<div class="cta-box govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
			<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Make copies of the will for your own records before you send the original to HMCTS. You should make copies of the will for your own records before you send the original to HMCTS - do not remove any staples or pages as this could lead to your application being delayed.</p>
		</div>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2.5 If you have a will or death certificate outside England or Wales</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">If the will and any updates to it (a codicil) is not in English or Welsh, you’ll need to provide a translation in English with the original before you send it to HMCTS. You do not have to translate the death certificate, we may contact you if we need more information.</p>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2.6 If they did not leave a will</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">If they have not left a will, this is known as the person has died ‘intestate’.The intestate rules will decide who can apply to manage the estate as an administrator and how the estate must be distributed.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">If you’re a spouse, civil partner or child over 18 you can apply as an administrator for a ‘letter of administration’ online, if you’re not any of these, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-pa1a-apply-for-probate-deceased-did-not-leave-a-will" target="_blank">apply for the letter by post</a>.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">If you are unsure, check if you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/inherits-someone-dies-without-will" target="_blank">inherit the estate</a> under the intestate rules.</p>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2.7 Check if you need to pay inheritance tax</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">The tax on the estate of a person who has died is called inheritance tax. Before you can apply for probate, you’ll need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died" target="_blank">work out the value of the estate </a>as you may need to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/inheritance-tax" target="_blank">pay some inheritance tax</a> using funds from the estate before probate can be granted.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">If they have not left a will, this is known as the person has died ‘intestate’.The intestate rules will decide who can apply to deal with the estate and how the estate must be distributed.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">If you’re a spouse, civil partner or child over 18 you can apply as an administrator for a ‘letter of administration’ online, if you’re not any of these, you’ll need to apply for the letter by post.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">If you are unsure, check if you can inherit the estate under the intestate rules.</p>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">2.8 Work out the value of the estate</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to tell us the estate’s value in your probate application, this should be the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who- died/tell-hmrc-estate-value" target="_blank">same amount</a> you reported to HMRC. Find out what you need to do to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone- who-died" target="_blank">report the estate’s value</a>.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">You may still need to pay inheritance tax after you get probate. HMRC will contact you if you need to pay this tax.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">If you have any questions about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/inheritance-tax" target="_blank">inheritance tax</a>, contact the Inheritance Tax Helpline on 0300 123 1072. Monday to Friday: 9 am to 5 pm.</p>
		<h2 id="who-can-apply" class="govuk-heading-l">3. Who can apply</h2>
		<p class="govuk-body">You can apply for a grant if you are over the age of 18 and:</p>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>you are an executor named in the will</li>
			<li>you are named in the will to receive some or all of the estate (if there are no executors, or if the executors are unable or unwilling to apply)</li>
			<li>the person who died did not make a will and you are their next of kin, in the following order of priority:</li>
		</ul>
		<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
			<li>lawful husband or wife or civil partner (you can apply if you were separated but still legally married or in a civil partnership when they died)</li>
			<li>sons or daughters including children over 18 years old adopted by the deceased (Stepchildren and children adopted out of the family of the person who has died cannot apply)</li>
			<li>parents</li>
			<li>brothers or sisters</li>
			<li>grandparents</li>
			<li>uncles or aunts</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="govuk-body">If none of the next of kin listed above are still alive, any of their children aged over 18 can apply for letters of administration.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">You cannot apply if you’re</p>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>the partner of the person but were not their spouse or civil partner when they died.</li>
			<li>Stepchild or adopted child of the family of the person who has died</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">3.1 If you’re an administrator</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">If you’re a spouse or civil partner you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-pa15-apply-for-renunciation-will" target="_blank">give up your rights</a> to apply for letters of administration so your child over 18 can apply and take responsibility for managing the estate.</p>
		<p class="govuk-body">If you would like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-pa12-apply-for-power-of-attorney-intestate" target="_blank">someone to act on your behalf</a>, you can appoint them to be your attorney to apply for letters of administration to manage the estate.</p>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">3.2 If you’re the sole executor named in the will</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">You have a responsibility to apply for probate unless you want to give up your rights (‘renunciation’’) to get the grant permanently. If the sole executor cannot apply or has died, check the content of the will for guidance on who might be able to apply. If you are still unsure, seek legal advice.</p>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">3.3 If there are no executors left</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">If all the executors named in the will have died or are not eligible to apply, you can <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-pa1p-apply-for-probate-the-deceased-had-a-will" target="_blank">apply for probate by post</a> for Letters of Administration with will annexed.</p>
		<h2 id="make-joint-application" class="govuk-heading-l">4. Make a joint application</h2>
		<p class="govuk-body">If more than one person is named as an executor and you all want to apply, you must all agree who makes the application for probate. Up to 4 people can apply. If only one executor applies they’ll need to explain why the other executors are not applying with them, for example, the other executors are reserving their rights. If you apply online, we will contact all executors to make them aware a probate application has been submitted.</p>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">4.1 If any executor on the will choose not to apply</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">Executors may choose to:</p>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-pa15-apply-for-renunciation-will" target="_blank">give up all their rights to a grant permanently</a> (‘renunciation’) or</li>
			<li>reserve their right, (‘power reserved’), to apply for a grant in the future. Unlike renunciation, power reserved will not stop them from applying for a grant at a later date</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/probate-forms" target="_blank">appoint an attorney</a> to apply on their behalf only if all executors agree to this. Persons appointed under an enduring Power of Attorney or Lasting Power of Attorney are also able to apply for probate on their behalf.)</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="govuk-body">If any executor chooses not to apply, you’ll need to send their renunciation or power of attorney documents in with your probate paper application.</p>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">4.2 If the executor is not unable to apply</h3>
		<p class="govuk-body">An executor may be unable to apply because:</p>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>they’ve died</li>
			<li>the person named in the will lacks the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/make-decisions-for-someone" target="_blank">mental capacity to apply for the grant</a>, their doctor should <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/form-pa14-medical-certificate-probate" target="_blank">declare this in a medical certificate</a> and send it with the probate application</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="apply-for-probate" class="govuk-heading-l">5. Apply for probate</h2>
		<p class="govuk-body">After you’ve <a href="https://www.gov.uk/valuing-estate-of-someone-who-died/tell-hmrc-estate-value" target="_blank">reported the estate’s value</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/paying-inheritance-tax" target="_blank">pay any inheritance tax</a> due, you can apply for probate online, in some circumstances, you can only apply by post.</p>
		<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">5.1 Things you’ll need before you apply online or by post:</h3>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
			<li>original will (if the person who died left a will) and any documents amending the will (codicils):</li>
			<li>original death certificate, this must be the original document, not a photocopy.</li>
			<li>if the death is registered in Wales,you’ll need to upload both sides of the certificate which is in English and Welsh</li>
			<li>if uploading online, it must be a high resolution image showing the watermark and in colour</li>
			<li>current and previous names of all the executors named in the will. For previous names, you’ll need to explain why their names have changed</li>
			<li>reason why any executors are not applying</li>
			<li>gross value of the estate: this is the total value of the assets including bank accounts, property and personal belongings as reported to HMRC</li>
			<li>net value of the estate: this is the total value of the assets after paying off debt and after any liabilities</li>
		</ul>
		<div class="cta-box govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">
			<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">You’ll not get the original will back as it becomes a public document when we grant you probate and by law, we must keep it in the public records. You should make copies of it before sending it to us.</p>
